I've been using Visual Studio 2012 on and off for a while, but recently put it on my main machine. No complaints. Here is what I like so far.

1. Dark theme
2. Faster builds
3. Projects still compatible with VS 2012
4. ReSharper 7.1
5. ViEMU 3.0.12
(Ok the last two aren't part of VS, but I still really like them)

I'm sure there are tons of cool features I don't even know about yet. This is an awesome upgrade to an excellent IDE.
