title: I miss my unit tests

One of my church leaders last year told us that if we read three pages per day 
in the Book of Mormon we will read it twice in one year. Thus he coined the 
phrase, "3 equals 2".

Although I liked the idea, I read my scriptures on my iPad which doesn't have 
page numbers. Therefore I decided to quickly create a site that would send
daily reminders based on the "3 equals 2" schedule that included not only pages
numbers, but also the start and end verse for people like me. The site went up
rather quickly ([3equals2.org](http://3equals2.org)) and sadly without any unit 
tests.

I lament not writing unit tests every time I work on this project. I've learned
that even small projects can quickly have logic that will benefit from unit 
tests. Thus even small projects I create will have unit tests in the future. 
Lesson learned.
