I'm always changing no surprises there. The hosting for my blog is due for renewal in three days and it's going to cost about $120. I've already been through three different blog engines and one thing I dislike about all of them is that I can't easily get my content out. This time I've decided to try using Markdown and Jekyll to generate a static site. We'll see how this venture goes :)
